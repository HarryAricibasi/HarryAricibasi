# Pig Aggression

| Project Link | Completion Date | Tools | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| üêñ [Pig Aggression Detection using CNN and image differentials](https://github.com/HarryAricibasi/HarryAricibasi/blob/c69f29dae24d99f86a66b4a96ff73c3cbac2549a/showcases/PigAggression.md) | April 2022 | Python, Tensorflow, Keras, OpenCV, Pandas | Collaborated with Dr. Bergeron, Dr. Tulpan, and Jasmine Fraser to build a machine learning pipeline for pig aggression detection, improving animal welfare and production efficiency. Managed data collection and annotation, implemented video processing scripts, and developed the Pig Aggression Recognition Tool (PART) to transform raw videos into labeled demonstrations. Co-wrote and published an article in the Journal of Animal Science: https://doi.org/10.1093/jas/skad347 |

# Livestock Mounting

| Project Link | Completion Date | Tools | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| üì∑ [Livestock Mounting Identification using Mask-R-CNN and overlap](https://github.com/HarryAricibasi/HarryAricibasi/blob/052cce8fd147df012bab60762a9173695e49db1f/showcases/LivestockMounting.md) | May 2024 | Python, Tensorflow, scikit-learn, OpenCV, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn | Developed an end-to-end solution to detect mounting behavior in boars to reduce stress and injuries for welfare and economic improvement. Utilized transfer learning to train a custom object detection model for real-time identification of pigs, leveraging vertical occlusion and mask fluctuation. Trained an SVM binary classifier to detect mounting behavior based on object detector outputs with engineered features. Achieved 97% testing accuracy and F1 score after optimization|
