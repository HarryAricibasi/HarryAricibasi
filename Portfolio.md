# Pig Aggression

| Project Link | Completion Date | Tools | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| üêñ [CNN & Image differentials](https://github.com/HarryAricibasi/Pig-Aggression-Detector-using-CNN-and-image-differentials) | April 2022 | Python, Tensorflow, OpenCV, Stratified Sampling, Automated Frame Extraction | Collaborated with Dr. Bergeron, Dr. Tulpan, and Jasmine Fraser to build a machine learning pipeline for pig aggression detection, improving animal welfare and production efficiency. Managed data collection and annotation, implemented video processing scripts, and developed the Pig Aggression Recognition Tool (PART) to transform raw videos into labeled demonstrations. Co-wrote and published an article in the Journal of Animal Science: https://doi.org/10.1093/jas/skad347 |

# Livestock Mounting

| Project Link | Completion Date | Tools | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| üì∑ [Mask-R-CNN and SVM](https://github.com/HarryAricibasi/Livestock-Mounting-Identifier-using-Mask-R-CNN-and-overlap) | May 2023 | ResNetV2 (Mask-R-CNN), Vertical Occlusion, Mask Fluctuation | Developed an end-to-end solution to detect mounting behavior in boars to reduce boar taint as an alternative to castration. Utilized transfer learning to train a custom object detection model for real-time identification of pigs, leveraging vertical occlusion and mask fluctuation to recognize mounting behaviors. |
